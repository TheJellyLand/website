      <h2>Jelly Tiers / Licensing</h2>
      <p>
        There are currently 3 tiers of Jelly's being brought into existence. From license perspective Jellyman LLC will retain the 
        rights to the characters and there likeness in order to continue to build the cartoon series, but you will own the NFT. 
        Multiple Jellys will be minted for each color hash as described below and allow for mass adoption and gameplay. 
        For unique Jelly's the goal is to only mint 1 NFT into existence as each will then be rare and unique.
        More details and exact licensing terms are subject to change still as more research is conducted else all rights are reserved by the creator.
      </p>
      <h3>Jelly</h3>
      These Jelly's represent the overall population of JellyLand and are released and tracked according to there color hash. Initially there are 4 batches planned each with increasing amount of quantity to reflect the growing population of JellyLand.
      <ul type="circle">
      
        <li> #D200C5 x 100 </li>   
        <li> TBD x 1000 </li>
        <li> TBD x 10000</li>
        <li> TBD x 100000</li>
      </ul>

      The inital waitlist for the first 100 is located <a style="color:revert" href="/amVsbHlsYW5kLmlv.html">here</a>
      <h3>Unique Jelly</h3>
      After being infected by the PbTTr compound Jelly's may exhibit unique characteristics. These Jelly's each have there own unique traits, looks, and personalities. There will be 200 of these created by hand to get started and many of them will be featured in the JellyLand comic series as well as merchandise. 
       These will be similar to the ones listed on <a style="color:revert" href="https://opensea.io/collection/thejellyland-collection">OpenSea</a> already.

      <h3>Custom Jelly</h3>
      This is a planned feature on our roadmap which will allow for other social media influencers to partner with JellyLand and receive a custom Jelly which reflects there own unique brand and identity. The commercial rights to these may be released to the purchaser for use in merchandising, games, etc. Promotion of these characters by JellyLand will also be incorporated.
